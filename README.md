# algorithms

This package serves as a general repository for functions that were
required in other context but would prove to be generic enough to be used
in other contexts.

After all, one major advantage of functional programming is composition
and code reuse. Code should be as much generic as possible in this repository
and should not require any specific context to seem useful.
